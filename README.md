# BACestimate
This Android Studio project is my first attempt at creating a complete mobile application.
The app is designed for alcohol drinkers, and it seeks to provide a simple and convienent way to keep track of a
user's Blood Alcohol Content as they engage in a session of drinking. 

You may have heard of the 'one drink an hour' rule for determining whether a drinker is safe to drive based on how many drinks they had.
My app provides a more precise determination of whether a drinker is safe to drive by calculating an estimation
of a user's BAC live using the known pharmokinetics of the absorbtion of ethanol, information about the user's body, and
the type and volume of beverage they are drinking.

My goal for this app is to provide for drinkers a fun app that they can use while drinking to "see how drunk they are" and at the
same time, should their BAC get near or above the legal limit, provide an assertive suggestion that 
they should NOT get behind the wheel. 
It may be easy to fudge the hour rule a bit if you just had a long night at the bar and you would like to get home fast,
but if a drinker is using my app and sees an concrete notification telling them that they are not safe to drive based on
a relatively accurate estimation of their BAC, it is my hope that they will be more likely to take a taxi home.
